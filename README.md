# Home-Assistant-Luxtronik

A Luxtronik heatpump component for Home Assistant

This component is going to use the "old" binary protocol that Alpha Innotec, the manufacturer of the Luxtronik heatpumps, used in its Java based webinterface. They added a new, websockets based webinterface in newer versions, but in order to make this a useful component to as much users as possible we decided to stick with the binary protocol.
Maybe we implement the new protocol in the future and make it configurable which protocol the component is going to use.
